### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eduardo


Full-stack software developer with a solid knowledge in design, mainly working on personal projects and self-employed making and maintaining registration systems.

I love to talk about computer programming, help beginners with bug fixing and I use to enjoy my weekends playing online games with my friends.
